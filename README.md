# Old Phone Pad Solution

This project simulates the input from an old phone pad and maps the numeric key presses to their corresponding letters.

### How it works:
- Enter digits to form letters (e.g., 2 -> "A", 22 -> "B").
- Use '*' to delete the last character.
- Use '#' to end input and display the result.

### Requirements:
- .NET SDK

### How to Run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile and run the C# file using any C# compiler or IDE.
